This repository contains exercises and experiments with **PHPUnit**, aimed at understanding unit testing in PHP. The focus is on writing and executing test cases, learning assertions, and structuring tests for maintainable code.

The project is strictly for academic purposes, serving as a reference for improving testing skills and applying best practices in PHP development.

Feel free to explore the test examples, run them locally, and adapt the exercises for your own learning.
